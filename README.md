## Summary
This is a project to get me started in videogame development, with substantial help from [Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/content) on Udemy.com.

## Goals
In this game I'll try to develop a full game, with clean code, a decent UI and some good mechanics to fully understand
how far can I improve in a limited time in my programming skills.
